# Error Handling and Logging Approach for AML System

## Context and Problem Statement

The AML system needs a consistent approach to error handling and logging across all components. We need to decide how to capture, handle, and log errors effectively to ensure system reliability, facilitate debugging, and maintain audit trails. The approach must help developers quickly identify and resolve issues while providing meaningful feedback to users.

## Decision Drivers

* Must provide clear error information for debugging
* Need to ensure sensitive information is not exposed to users
* Must support different types of errors (validation, system, network)
* Should enable quick problem identification and resolution
* Must maintain audit trails for critical operations
* Should be consistent across all system components
* Must be scalable and manageable as the system grows
* Should not impact system performance significantly

## Considered Options

### Error Handling Approaches

* Global error handling with middleware
* Try-catch with specific error types
* Error boundary components for React
* Custom error handling service
* Third-party error monitoring services

### Logging Solutions

* Console logging with structured format
* File-based logging system
* Centralised logging service
* Third-party logging platforms
* Custom logging implementation

## Decision Outcome

Chosen approach: "Layered error handling with structured logging", because:

1. Provides consistent error handling across all system layers
2. Enables meaningful error messages for users
3. Maintains detailed logs for debugging
4. Separates user-facing errors from system logs
5. Supports future integration with monitoring tools
6. Allows for easy error tracking and analysis
7. Maintains security by controlling error exposure

### Planned Implementation Approach

1. Error Handling Strategy:
   * Frontend error boundaries
   * API error middleware
   * Typed error definitions
   * User-friendly error messages
   * Error severity levels

2. Logging Structure:
   * Log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
   * Structured log format
   * Contextual information capture
   * Performance impact considerations

3. Monitoring Strategy:
   * Error tracking metrics
   * Critical error alerts
   * Performance monitoring
   * Usage patterns analysis

### Consequences

* Good, because it provides comprehensive error tracking
* Good, because it enables quick problem resolution
* Good, because it maintains security of sensitive information
* Bad, because it requires additional setup and maintenance
* Bad, because it needs careful management of log storage

### Confirmation

We will validate this decision through:

1. Testing error scenarios
2. Log analysis effectiveness
3. Developer feedback on debugging
4. Performance impact assessment
5. Security review of error exposure

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Global Error Handling with Middleware

* Good, because of centralised error management
* Good, because of consistent error handling
* Good, because of simplified implementation
* Bad, because of potential single point of failure
* Bad, because of less flexibility for specific cases

### Custom Error Handling Service

* Good, because of full control over implementation
* Good, because of tailored to specific needs
* Bad, because of increased development time
* Bad, because of maintenance overhead
* Neutral, because of learning curve for team

### Third-party Error Monitoring

* Good, because of built-in analysis tools
* Good, because of managed service benefits
* Bad, because of potential costs
* Bad, because of external dependency
* Bad, because of data privacy concerns
