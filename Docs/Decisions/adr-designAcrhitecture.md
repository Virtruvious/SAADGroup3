# System Architecture Design for AML System

## Context and Problem Statement

The AML system needs a robust and maintainable architecture that effectively separates concerns and manages communication between different system components. We need to determine the best architectural approach that supports our requirements for separate frontend and backend services, API-based communication, and modular design while ensuring system reliability and maintainability.

## Decision Drivers

* Must support clear separation of frontend and backend services
* Need to ensure efficient API communication
* Must enable modular development and maintenance
* Should support independent scaling of components
* Must facilitate team development
* Should enable easy testing and debugging
* Must support future system extensions
* Should minimize coupling between components

## Considered Options

### Architecture Patterns

* Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
* Monolithic Architecture
* Microservices Architecture
* Layered Architecture
* Event-Driven Architecture

### Communication Patterns

* RESTful APIs
* GraphQL
* gRPC
* Message Queue
* Direct Database Access

## Decision Outcome

Chosen approach: "Service-Oriented Architecture with RESTful APIs", because:

1. Provides clear separation of concerns
2. Enables modular development
3. Supports API-first approach
4. Facilitates independent component development
5. Allows for service reusability
6. Matches team's technical expertise
7. Supports future system evolution

### Planned Architecture Design

1. Service Organization:
   * Frontend service (Next.js)
   * Backend API services
   * Database service
   * Authentication service
   * Notification service

2. Communication Strategy:
   * RESTful API endpoints
   * Standardized request/response formats
   * Error handling protocols
   * Service discovery mechanism

3. Data Flow:
   * Client-server communication
   * Inter-service communication
   * Data consistency strategy
   * Cache management

### Consequences

* Good, because it enables clear service boundaries
* Good, because it supports independent service development
* Good, because it facilitates API-based integration
* Bad, because it requires careful API design
* Bad, because it needs proper service coordination

### Confirmation

We will validate this decision through:

1. API design review
2. Service integration testing
3. Performance assessment
4. Developer workflow evaluation
5. Architecture prototype

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Service-Oriented Architecture

* Good, because of clear service boundaries
* Good, because of modular development
* Good, because of service reusability
* Bad, because of communication overhead
* Bad, because of service coordination complexity

### Monolithic Architecture

* Good, because of simplicity
* Good, because of easier deployment
* Bad, because of tight coupling
* Bad, because of scaling limitations
* Bad, because of reduced flexibility

### Microservices Architecture

* Good, because of high scalability
* Good, because of service independence
* Bad, because of excessive complexity
* Bad, because of operational overhead
* Bad, because of distributed system challenges
