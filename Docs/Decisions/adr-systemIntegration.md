# System Integration Architecture for AML System

## Context and Problem Statement

The AML system needs an integration architecture to handle communication between various system components, particularly for managing notifications and payment records. We need to determine the most effective way to handle internal state changes, notify users of important updates, and maintain data consistency across the system without relying on external services.

## Decision Drivers

* Must enable reliable communication between system components
* Need to ensure data consistency across different operations
* Should be simple to implement and maintain
* Must be cost-effective for our scale
* Should support future growth and potential external integrations
* Must maintain proper audit trails
* Should integrate well with our chosen database structure
* Must support user notification requirements

## Considered Options

* Event-driven architecture with message queue
* Direct database integration with triggers
* Simple API-based integration
* Microservices architecture
* Webhook-based system

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Simple API-based integration with direct database access", because:

1. Aligns with our system's current scope and complexity
2. Provides straightforward implementation path
3. Maintains data consistency through direct operations
4. Minimizes infrastructure requirements
5. Reduces potential points of failure
6. Allows for future expansion if needed
7. Matches team's technical expertise

### Planned Immplementation Details

1. Component Integration:
   * Internal API endpoints for system communications
   * Direct database operations for data consistency
   * Standardized request/response formats

2. Notification System:
   * Database-backed notification storage
   * Read/unread status tracking
   * Support for different notification types
   * User-specific notification queries

3. Security Measures:
   * Access control for all operations
   * Audit logging of system changes
   * Data validation protocols

### Consequences

* Good, because it maintains simplicity in design
* Good, because it ensures direct data consistency
* Good, because it will be easier to test and debug
* Bad, because it may need restructuring for external integrations
* Bad, because scaling might require architectural changes

### Confirmation

We will validate this decision through:

1. Proof of concept implementation
2. Performance testing plan
3. Security review
4. User acceptance criteria validation
5. Integration testing strategy

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Simple API-based Integration

* Good, because of straightforward implementation
* Good, because of direct data consistency
* Good, because of easier maintenance
* Bad, because of potential scaling limitations
* Bad, because of tighter coupling between components

### Event-driven Architecture

* Good, because of loose coupling between components
* Good, because of better scaling potential
* Bad, because of unnecessary complexity for our needs
* Bad, because of increased infrastructure needs
* Bad, because of more complex error handling

### Microservices Architecture

* Good, because of service isolation
* Good, because of independent scaling
* Bad, because of excessive complexity for our needs
* Bad, because of increased operational overhead
* Bad, because of more complex deployment

## More Information

To implement this decision, we will need:

1. System Design Requirements:
   * Component interaction diagrams
   * Data flow documentation
   * API interface specifications
   * Security requirements
   * Performance requirements

2. Development Planning:
   * Technical specification document
   * Testing strategy
   * Security review plan
   * Performance benchmarking criteria

3. Future Considerations:
   * Scaling strategy
   * External integration possibilities
   * Backup and recovery procedures
   * Monitoring requirements
