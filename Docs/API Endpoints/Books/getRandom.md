      "description": "A lone astronaut.\r\nAn impossible mission.\r\nAn ally he never imagined.\r\n\r\nRyland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission - and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish.\r\n\r\nExcept that right now, he doesn't know that. He can't even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it.\r\n\r\nAll he knows is that he's been asleep for a very, very long time. And he's just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.\r\n\r\nHis crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, Ryland realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Hurtling through space on this tiny ship, it's up to him to puzzle out an impossible scientific mystery-and conquer an extinction-level threat to our species.\r\n\r\nAnd with the clock ticking down and the nearest human being light-years away, he's got to do it all alone.\r\n\r\nOr does he?\r\n\r\nAn irresistible interstellar adventure as only Andy Weir could imagine it, Project Hail Mary is a tale of discovery, speculation, and survival to rival The Martian -- while taking us to places it never dreamed of going.\r\n\r\nPublisher: Cornerstone\r\nISBN: 9781529157468\r\nNumber of pages: 496\r\nWeight: 345 g\r\nDimensions: 198 x 129 x 29 mm",

      "description": "The bestseller behind the major film from Ridley Scott, starring Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain.\r\n\r\nI'm stranded on Mars. I have no way to communicate with Earth. I'm in a Habitat designed to last 31 days.\r\n\r\nIf the Oxygenator breaks down, I'll suffocate. If the Water Reclaimer breaks down, I'll die of thirst. If the Hab breaches, I'll just kind of explode. If none of those things happen, I'll eventually run out of food and starve to death.\r\n\r\nSo yeah. I'm screwed.\r\nAfter a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive.\r\n\r\nChances are, though, he won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old \"human error\" are much more likely to kill him first.\r\n\r\nBut Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills—and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit—he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?\r\n\r\nA fan of The Martian? Read Andy Weir's second novel Artemis\r\n\r\n“A book I just couldn’t put down! It has the very rare combination of a good, original story, interestingly real characters and fascinating technical accuracy…reads like “MacGyver” meets “Mysterious Island.” - Astronaut Chris Hadfield, Commander of the International Space Station and author of An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth\r\nPublisher: Cornerstone\r\nISBN: 9780091956141\r\nNumber of pages: 384\r\nWeight: 263 g\r\nDimensions: 197 x 126 x 23 mm",
